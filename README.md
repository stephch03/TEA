# Timesheet Entry Application

## *Overview*

I work for a small local business which still manually calculates the number of hours worked by each employee on paper.
I find it inefficient and it is prone to calculation errors. In this day and age, we should be able to digitalize 
this process.

This timesheet entry application will allow company employees to enter the number of hours they worked.
Management can approve and adjust employees' hours, sick days, and vacation time as needed. Upon management's approval, 
the application will summarize the number of hours worked so that this information can be forwarded to payroll.


A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
