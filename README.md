# Timesheet Entry Application

## *Overview*

I work for a small local business which still manually calculates the number of hours worked by each employee on paper.
It is inefficient and also prone to calculation errors. In this day and age, the process should be digitalized.

This **timesheet entry application** will allow company managers to keep track of the number of hours employees
have worked. Management can adjust employees' hours, sick days, and vacation time as appropriate.
Upon management's approval of the hours, the application will summarize the number of hours worked by each employee
so that this information can be forwarded to payroll.
